===========================================

Playbook "lxc-create.yml" fails to create lxc container.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Verify python virtual environment is activated by running *which
   ansible-playbook*. This should return the path
   \*/cluster-genesis/deployenv/bin/ansible-playbook. If something else
   is returned (including nothing) cd into the cluster-genesis directory
   and re-run *source scripts/setup-env*.

Verify network bridge named "br0" is up and connected to the management
network. Verify that the bridge\_ports interface has a carrier:

*cat /sys/class/net/p1p1/carrier*

*1*

Verify bridge br0 has an ip address assigned;

ip a show br0

Switch connectivity Issues:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Verify connectivity from deployer container to managment interfaces
   of both management and data switches. Be sure to use values assigned
   to the [ipaddr,userid,password]-[mgmt,data]-switch keys in the
   config.yml. These switches can be on any subnet except the one to be
   used for your cluster managment network, as long as they're
   accessible to the deployer system.
-  Verify SNMP is enabled on both switches. Run *show snmp-server* on
   the switch command line interface (command could vary).
-  Verify SSH is enabled on the data switch and that the user can ssh
   directly from deployer to the switch using the ipaddr,userid, and
   password keys defined in the config.yml

Missing Hardware 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware can fail to show up for various reasons. Most of the time these
are do to miscabling or mistakes in the config.yml file. The Node
discovery process starts with discovery of mac addresses and DHCP hand
out of ip addresses to the BMC ports of the cluster nodes. This process
can be monitored by checking the DHCP lease table after booting the BMCs
of the cluster nodes. During execution of the install.yml playbook, at
the prompt;

"Please reset BMC interfaces to obtain DHCP leases. Press <enter> to
continue"

After rebooting the BMCs and before pressing <enter>, you can execute
from a second shell;

*deployer@ubuntu-14-04-deployer:~$ cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases *

*1471870835 a0:42:3f:30:61:cc 192.168.3.173 \* 01:a0:42:3f:30:61:cc*

*1471870832 70:e2:84:14:0a:10 192.168.3.153 \* 01:70:e2:84:14:0a:10*

*1471870838 a0:42:3f:32:6f:3f 192.168.3.159 \* 01:a0:42:3f:32:6f:3f*

*1471870865 a0:42:3f:30:61:fe 192.168.3.172 \* 01:a0:42:3f:30:61:fe*

**To follow the progress you can execute;**

*deployer@ubuntu-14-04-deployer:~$ tail -f /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
*

**You can also check what switch ports these mac addresses are connected
to by logging into the management switch and executing;**

*RS G8052>show mac-address-table*

* MAC address VLAN Port Trnk State Permanent Openflow*

* ----------------- -------- ------- ---- ----- --------- --------*

* 00:00:5e:00:01:99 1 48 FWD N *

* 00:16:3e:53:ae:19 1 20 FWD N *

* 0c:c4:7a:76:c8:ec 1 37 FWD N *

* 40:f2:e9:23:82:be 1 11 FWD N *

* 40:f2:e9:24:96:5e 1 1 FWD N *

* 5c:f3:fc:31:05:f0 1 15 FWD N *

* 5c:f3:fc:31:06:2a 1 18 FWD N *

* 5c:f3:fc:31:06:2c 1 17 FWD N *

* 5c:f3:fc:31:06:ec 1 13 FWD N *

* 70:e2:84:14:02:92 1 3 FWD N *

**For missing mac addresses, verify that port numbers in the above
printout match the ports specified in the config.yml file. Mistakes can
be corrected by correcting cabling, correcting the config.yml file and
rebooting the BMCs.**

**Mistakes in the config.yml file require a restart of the install.yml
playbook. Before restarting, make a backup of any existing inventory.yml
files and then create an empty inventory.yml file.**

*mv inventory.yml inventory.yml.bak*

*> inventory.yml*

****

****

**Once all the BMC mac addresses have been given leases, press return in
the genesis execution window.**

**Common Supermicro PXE bootdev Failure**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Supermicro servers often fail to boot PXE devices on first try. In
order to get the MAC addresses of the PXE ports our code sets the
bootdev on all nodes to pxe and initiates a power on. Supermicro servers
do *\ **not**\ * reliably boot pxe (usually will instead choose one of
the disks). This *\ *will usually show up as a python key error in the
"container/inv\_add\_pxe\_ports.yml" playbook. The only remedy is to
retry the PXE boot until it's successful (usually *\ *within*\ * 2-3
tries). To retry use ipmitool from the deployer. The tricky part,
however, is determining 1) which systems failed to PXE boot and 2) what
the current BMC IP address is. **

****

**To determine which systems have failed to boot, go through the
following bullets in this section (starting with "Verify port
lists..."). **

****

**To determine what the corresponding BMC addresss is view the
inventory.yml file. At this point the BMC ipv4 and mac address will
already be populated in the inventory.yml within the container. To find
out: **

*Stopping and resuming progress*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, to resume progress after a play stops on error (presumably
after the error has been understood and corrected!) the failed playbook
should be re-run and subsequent plays run as normal. In the case of
"cluster-genesis/playbooks/install.yml" around 20 playbooks are
included. If one of these playbooks fail then edit
"cluster-genesis/playbooks/install.yml" and comment plays that have
passed by writing a "#" at the front of the line. Be sure *not* to
comment out the playbook that failed so that it will re-run. Here's an
example of a modified "cluster-genesis/playbooks/install.yml" where the
user wishes to resume after a data switch connectivity problem caused
the "container/set\_data\_switch\_config.yml" playbook to fail:

**Recovering from Wrong IPMI userid and /or password **
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**If the userid or password for the ipmi ports are wrong, genesis will
fail. To fix this, first correct the userid and or password in the
config.yml file (~/cluster-genesis/config.yml in both the host OS and
the container). Also correct the userid and or password in the container
at ~/cluster-genesis/inventory.yml. Then modify the
~/cluster-genesis/playbooks/install.yml file, commenting out the
playbooks shown below. Then rerstart genesis from step 15(rerun the
install playbook)**

**Recreating the Genesis Container**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**To destroy the Genesis container and restart Genesis from that
point;**

**sudo lxc-ls --fancy**

**sudo lxc-stop *\ *-n deployer-container-name**

**sudo lxc-destroy -n deployer-container-name**

**Restart genesis from step 15 of the step by step instructions.
*\ *`5.1 <#anchor-7>`__*\ * *\ *`Installing and Running the Genesis
code. Step by Step Instructions <#anchor-7>`__**

**NOTE: if you have exited the shell session from which you previously
created the container, be sure to execute the following setup scripts;**

***\ source ~/cluster-genesis/scripts/setup-env*

*export ANSIBLE\_HOST\_KEY\_CHECKING=False*

**After recreating the container, you will need to remove the old key
from the known\_hosts file in order to be able to ssh into the recreated
container;**

*ssh-keygen -f "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/known\_hosts" -R 192.168.0.2*

Reinstalling Genesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before reinstalling genesis, stop and destroy the deployer container;

**sudo lxc-ls --fancy**

**sudo lxc-stop *\ *-n deployer-container-name**

**sudo lxc-destroy -n deployer-container-name**

Then remove the cluster-genesis directory. Follow instructions of
section `5 <#anchor-6>`__ `Running the OpenPOWER Cluster Configuration
Software <#anchor-6>`__

OpenPOWER Node issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifying the target drive for operating system install;

In the config.yml file, the *os-disk* key is the disk to which the
operating system will be installed. Specifying this disk is not always
obvious because Linux naming is insconsistent between boot and final OS
install. For OpenPOWER S812LC, the two drives in the rear of the unit
are typically used for OS install. These drives should normally be
specified as /dev/sdj and /dev/sdk

PXE boot: OpenPOWER nodes need to have the Ethernet port used for PXE
booting enabled for DHCP in petitboot.

Be sure to specify a disk configured for boot as the bootOS drive in the
config.yml file.

When using IPMI, be sure to specify the right user id and password. IPMI
will generate an "unable to initiate IPMI session errors" if the
password is not correct.
